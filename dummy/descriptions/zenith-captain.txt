The Captain Chronograph, 42 mm in diameter, has a highly legible dial, earning praise from Lenhart, who also liked the watch’s wearing comfort. The simple but well-shaped stainless steel case fits well around the wrist, and the comfort is further enhanced by the high quality of the rubber-lined alligator strap. Long, white wedges mark the hours. These team up with elegantly tapering white hands that contrast clearly with the black dial and the chronograph functions. The chronograph indicators are easy to read, as is the small-seconds subdial and the date at 6 o’clock.
